# Predict Credit Consumption of Customer For a Leading Bank Using Linear Regression

**Business Context:**
Analytics driving every industry based on a variety of technology platforms which collect information from various sources by analysing what customers certainly want. The Credit Card industry is also data rich industry and data can be leveraged in infinite ways to understand customer behaviour.
The data from a credit card processor shows the consumer types and their business spending behaviours. Therefore, companies can develop the marketing campaigns that directly address consumers’ behaviour. In return, this helps to make better sales and the revenue undoubtedly grows greater sales.
Understanding the consumption pattern for credit cards at an individual consumer level is important for customer relationship management. This understanding allows banks to customize for consumers and make strategic marketing plans. Thus it is imperative to study the relationship between the characteristics of the consumers and their consumption patterns.

**Business Objectives:**
One of the leading banks provided below data
a.	Customer Demographics

c.	Credit consumption
Note: Some customers are having missing values for credit consumption. You need to build the model using customer’s data where credit consumption is non- missing’s. You need to predict the credit consumption for next three months for the customers having missing values.

**Model Evaluation Metric:**
You should validate model using Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) between the predicted credit card consumption and Actual Credit Consumption.

**Expected Outputs:**
a.	Detailed code with comments
b.	Data Exploratory analysis
c.	Model validation outputs
d.  Predicted values for customers where target variable having missing values
